# multi-glob

> Glob all the patterns!

`multi-glob` is a small wrapper around [node-glob](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob)
that allows you to glob multiple patterns in one go, and optionally treat it as a failure
if any one pattern matches no files.

If you just need to glob multiple patterns in one go, you can simply do:

```javascript
var glob = require("multi-glob").glob;
glob(["all", "the", "patterns"], cb);
```

However, with `multi-glob`, you can do a "strict" glob, which will cause an
error if e.g. the pattern `"the"` in the previous example matched no files.


## API

### `multiGlob.glob(patterns[, options], callback);`

Works like [node-glob's glob](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob>), with the
following two exceptions:

* `patterns` may be either a string pattern or an array of string patterns
* `options` may include `strict`. When set to `true`, `glob` will yield
  an error if either one of `patterns` matches no files.
